            <span class="initial-letter">I</span>n 2019, many of us are using the internet to accomplish our work. New technologies have enabled us to increase our productivity as knowledge workers beyond what was previously possible. The information we need to do our work is cheaper and easier to access than ever before.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these advances can be a double-edged sword. Knowledge is free, but we have become unwilling vendors in an attention economy that distracts us with every click, scroll and refresh. In turn, we often find ourselves unable to focus on our most important work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work we are paid for, or work we do for fun is intercepted by clickbait headlines, autoplaying videos and the impulses we have developed on the backs of these designs.

          <h3>Website blockers are dumb</h3>
          <p>
            Blockers like StayFocusd and Freedom are good for completely preventing access to certain websites that are absolute distractions, but they lack intelligence - they either block or they don't.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes sites like YouTube or Reddit are acutally useful for helping you to accomplish your work, and moreover they can only block as many websites as you give them.

          <h3>Introducing an intelligent website blocker</h3>
          <p>
            Natural language processing and other heuristics are used to try and understand what you are working on and whether any new page that you open is on task or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time you get distracted, it takes extra time and effort to return to the original task. Conscientious prevents this distraction and trains you to stay on task.
