          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
          <p>
            Deepmode Inc. (“Deepmode”) operates the Deepmode service, which we hope You (the “Customer”, “You”, or “Your”) use. If You use it, please use it responsibly. If You don’t, we’ll have to terminate Your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            For paid accounts, you’ll be charged on a monthly basis or annual basis, depending on the plan you chose. You can cancel anytime, and we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.
          </p>
          <p>
            You own the business data that you provide to Deepmode and You’re responsible for keeping it safe.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            The Terms of Service (the “Terms”), the Deepmode Service (as defined herein), and our prices can change at any time, but current customers will be grandfathered in at their original pricing. We’ll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms or Deepmode, but we make no guarantees.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            That’s the basic idea, but you must read through the entire below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites (whether or not You have created an account).
          </p>

          <h2>Your Agreement with Deepmode</h2>
          <p>
            Your use of the Deepmode Service is governed by these Terms. The “Service” means the services Deepmode makes available include our web sites (https://deepmode.app/), our blog, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Deepmode in connection to any of those.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to use the Service, You must first agree to the Terms. You understand and agree that Deepmode will treat Your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deepmode may make changes to the Terms from time to time. You may reject the changes by terminating Your account. You understand and agree that if You use the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, Deepmode will treat Your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any question about the Terms, please contact us at emilepw93@gmail.com.
          </p>
          <h2>Your Account</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You may not use the Service if You are a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United Kingdom or other countries, including the country in which You are resident or from which You use the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not use the service unless you are over the age of 13.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must be a human. Account created by automated methods are not permitted.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Use of the Service</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time You register to use the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are responsible for the security of Your passwords and for any use of Your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree to not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deepmode reserves the right to enforce quotas and usage limits (to any resources, including the API) at its sole discretion, with or without notice, which may result in Deepmode disabling or throttling Your usage of the Service for any amount of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not allow multiple people to use the same account or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

            <li>
              You may not add additional website properties within the Service and be directly compensated for them outside of Deepmode. This means that if you are a consultant or agency, you cannot add website properties for your clients and have them pay you on an arbitrary scheme. Your client will need to pay for their own Deepmode account and give You administrative access to their account.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Service Policies and Privacy</h2>
          <p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>

          </p>
          <p>
            Subject to and conditioned upon Your compliance with these Terms, we grant to you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to You by Deepmode as part of the Service as provided to You by Deepmode. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling You to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by Deepmode, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ALL STATUTORY WARRANTIES, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE IS MERCHANTABLE, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURATE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGING. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE OR ACCURATE OR WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

          </p>
          <h2>Limitations on Liability</h2>
          <p>
            YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH US IS THE CANCELLATION OF YOUR REGISTRATION. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES, IF ANY, THAT YOU PAID TO UTILIZE THE SERVICE OR (B) TEN POUNDS (£10).

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
          </p>
          <h2>Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Deepmode, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to (a) Your breach of the Terms, (b) Your use of the Service, or (c) Your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Service, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Deepmode will provide You with written notice of such claim, suit or action.
          </p>
          <h2>Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            The Terms of Service shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom as applied to contracts made and performed entirely within the United Kingdom, without giving effect to any conflicts of law statutes. Any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or related to the Terms, the Privacy Policy or the Service shall be settled by final and binding arbitration to be conducted by an arbitration tribunal in the United Kingdom. Any and all disputes that You may have with Deepmode shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.
          </p>
          <h2>General Legal Terms</h2>
          <p>
            The Terms, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the whole legal agreement between You and Deepmode and govern Your use of the Service and completely replace any prior agreements between You and Deepmode in relation to the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The failure of Deepmode to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that if Deepmode does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Deepmode has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Deepmode’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Deepmode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deepmode shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may assign this contract at any time to any parent, subsidiary, or any affiliated company, or as part of the sale to, merger with, or other transfer of our company to another entity.
